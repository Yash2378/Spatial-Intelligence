# Initial Ideas for Spatial Intelligence Project

## What is Spatial Intelligence?

Spatial intelligence refers to the ability of an agent to understand and manipulate the space around it. In this project, we will explore how AI systems can develop or simulate spatial awareness to improve decision-making in tasks such as navigation, object recognition, and environment mapping.

## Key Areas of Interest:

1. **Spatial Data Processing**: 
   - How can AI process 2D and 3D spatial data effectively?
   - What techniques are used to transform sensory inputs (e.g., vision, LIDAR) into spatial understanding?

2. **Simulation of Spatial Reasoning**: 
   - How can machines simulate tasks like object manipulation, distance estimation, or pathfinding?
   - Explore reinforcement learning and computer vision algorithms.

3. **Applications**:
   - Autonomous navigation (drones, vehicles)
   - Augmented and virtual reality environments
   - Robotics in smart homes and industries

## Next Steps

- Conduct research on existing methods of spatial intelligence in AI.
- Explore potential models (e.g., reinforcement learning, convolutional neural networks).
- Develop a prototype that can handle basic spatial reasoning tasks.
