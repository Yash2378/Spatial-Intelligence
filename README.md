# Spatial Intelligence Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on exploring and building capabilities in **Spatial Intelligence**. The primary goal is to understand and simulate spatial reasoning, with applications ranging from robotics, AR/VR environments, to cognitive AI systems.

### Goals

- Research how machines can simulate human-like spatial awareness.
- Develop models that can understand and process spatial data.
- Explore applications of spatial intelligence in real-world environments like navigation, smart cities, or robotics.

## Future Directions

- **AI-driven Spatial Mapping**: Investigate how AI can generate or enhance spatial maps.
- **Object Recognition**: Incorporate object detection and recognition as part of spatial intelligence.
- **Real-world Applications**: Focus on integrating this research with real-world systems, like drones, autonomous vehicles, and virtual reality.

## Getting Started

Since this is the early phase of the project, the next steps include:
- Conducting research on spatial intelligence.
- Exploring potential models and frameworks for spatial data processing.
- Creating initial prototypes and algorithms that simulate spatial awareness.
